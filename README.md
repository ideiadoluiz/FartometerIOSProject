# FartometerIOSProject
FartometerIOSProject is one solution that allows you to make fart battle with your friends, showing how strong are your farts and theirs.

### Usage

First of all, you should set your Facebook SDK for iOS location. The default install location is **~/Documents/FacebookSDK**, according to Facebook.  The SDK version that we are using is located at **third/FacebookSDKs-iOS-20151007.zip**, so you need to unzip and configure the path more suitable to yourself. Having any problem with understanding that, you should visit [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com)'s iOS section.

After that, you should probably configure your info.plist file with your **FacebookAppID** key.
